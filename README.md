🌐 Introducing My Latest Web App: Built with Minimal Resources! 🌐

Excited to share a web app I recently developed using minimal resources. 🎉 The entire app is powered by YouTube's backend, delivering a smooth and efficient experience by pulling all video data directly from YouTube’s API.

Key Features:

🔄 Real-time video updates
📱 Seamless YouTube Shorts integration
🎥 Video content dynamically fetched and displayed
⚡ Efficient API credit usage and performance optimization
This project is a great example of how you can build a fully functional web application with a lean tech stack while leveraging third-party APIs. 🚀
